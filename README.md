# QuickRatios

One of my original scripts. Useful for quickly calculating ratios. Enter numbers in three out of four fields, doesn't matter where. Your ratio will be calculated. When you edit a field, the ratio will be updated as well.

## Detailed instructions

To calculate ratios, first enter numbers in any of the three text entry fields. You can also increase or decrease each number by clicking the arrows to the right of the text entry field. The fourth number will automatically be calculated.

To disable automatic calculation, unset the "auto" button.
